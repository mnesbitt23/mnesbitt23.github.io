        <p> Emma Lambert is from Concrete, Washington. She is currently attending Carroll College, and will graduate this spring with a Bachelor of Arts in Communication Studies, with minors in social media and marketing. However, she also has a certificate in love, and matchmaking, which comes from years of setting her friends up with other friends, whether they wanted her services or not.
        </p>

        <p> Disclaimer: She takes credit for setting couples up, but what happens after is not her fault. Unless it is a success, and the match gets married, and lives happily ever after. Then she will take full credit for it </p>
