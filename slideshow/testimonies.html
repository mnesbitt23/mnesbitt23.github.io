            "Emma has set me up with one of her good friends from high school, and things are going great so far. We have a lot in common, and are going on a date soon! Without Emma, I would not have found this match." - Josie
        </p>

        <p> "Emma didn't necessarily set up my boyfriend and I, but she did predict that things would go well for us, and so far they have! Even though she didn't set us up, I still 100% trust her judgement when it comes to who is a good match for me, since she is always honest, just like she will be honest with you when you come to her looking for your perfect match" - Maddy</p>

        <p> Emma set my boyfriend and I up in high school, and we ended up dating for a year. Even though we broke up, it was a great relationship, and it was all because of Emma." -Jessie</p>
