<h1> My Review of Three Websites</h1>
<h2> Georgetown University: Good</h2>
<p>
    I chose this website because I am currently considering Georgetown’s law school. It immediately caught my eye right when I clicked on the home screen. The main visual on the first page is a video montage of the university, students, and campus life which I thought was very unique. When I looked at the code, I recognized elements that we have been using in class.
    There was a lot of information on the home page, which was one thing that I did not like about the layout. It was a bit overwhelming at first. Also, on the home page, the bottom portion was social media links, primarily from their Twitter page which I thought was a unique way for a prospective student to learn more about the university. This website is fairly easy to navigate and is done well. You can easily find what you are looking for, and there are categories at the top of the page which make it easier to find what you are looking for, such “Campus and City” and “Academic Life.” Their color scheme mostly consists blue and white, with some gray, which is very simple, but pleasing to the eye. I think that it does match their product, since their athletic team colors are blue and gray, so it shows their school spirit and pride.

<h2> Yale Art School: Bad</h2>
<p>
    This website is probably one of the ugliest websites that I have ever seen. The background on the home page is uneven, and is of a X-rayed hand. When you click to move to a different page, such as “About the School” the background changes to a moving background of a goat on top of another goat, which is very distracting, and seems irrelevant to the art school. Each page of the website has a similar distracting background. I think that this is what sets it apart from other websites, since I had never seen moving images for a background before. I was a little confused looking at the code, which makes sense as to why the website is so confusing. You would think that an Ivy League school would have a great website, but apparently not. I’m not sure why anyone would want to attend this art school after looking at this website. This website uses so many colors – green, blue, yellow, orange, which makes it look garish. It might match the audience, since in art school many different colors are used, but I think they could have done that in a more subtle, less garish way. It could have been more consistent throughout the website as well. All of the text is set primarily to the left side, leaving lots of empty space on the right side. Overall, this website makes me want to avoid Yale’s art school at all costs.

<h2> Visit Seattle: Good</h2>
<p>The last website I chose to review is Visit Seattle, since I am from the Seattle area. I like this website because it is easy to navigate, and immediately catches my eye. I love the first image on their home screen, which shows the skyline at sunset. Furthermore, due to the latest coronavirus, their website states “While we are physically distant for the time being, we hope this will help you feel a little more connected to the city you’ve come to love.” I thought this was a unique way of marketing the site, and getting visitors to learn more about the city. You can look and learn about Seattle “from a distance.” The homepage has various categories such as “Virtual Seattle Experiences”, “Museums” and “Live Web Cams”. You can click on these categories and more to learn more about them. This is really helpful especially if you are trying to plan a trip to Seattle. Some of the main colors that I noticed they used were black, and green. This makes sense, since Seattle is in “The Evergreen State”, and green is a color used for all professional sporting teams in the city (Seattle Seahawks, Seattle Mariners, Seattle Storm..) You can also click to their regular webpage, which is essentially the same, just without the coronavirus, and virtual aspects such as the live webcams and livestreams links meant to help people kill boredom during this virus.
