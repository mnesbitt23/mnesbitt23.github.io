 <h1> Review of State Websites</h1>
 <h2> 1. Vermont</h2> Here is the <a href=http://www.vermont.gov/ target="_new"> link to Vermont.</a>.
 This was my favorite website between these five websites. Green is one of my favorite colors, and it was on this webpage a lit. I twas very eye pleasing to me. I found that the website loaded very quickly, even when I moved to other parts of the page. The website was easy to navigate and I like how you could quickly find what you were looking for thanks to the categories they had listed which were "Live", "Work", "Explore", "Learn", "Government" and "Online Services"
 <h3> 2. Tennessee</h3> Here is the <a href=https://www.tn.gov/ target="_new"> link to Tennessee.</a>
 On Tennessee's website, it was also very pleasing to look at. I think that their website layout was very simple, and the colors that they utilized primarily, blue and white looked good together. I like how each topic was laid out side by side on the front page, and it was easy to find what I was looking for.
 <h4>3. Iowa </h4> Here is the <a href=http://www.iowa.gov/ target="_new"> link to Iowa.</a>. What I liked about Iowa's webpage was that it was also very easy to navigate, and had categories that you could click on for for information such as "Business", "Government" "Health" "Education" "General" and "Contact". The background was interesting to look as well, and it seemed to be a major city in Iowa. They also had "Quick Links" which included "Travel Iowa" and "Future Ready Job Skill Development". The website loaded very quickly as well.
 <h5> 4. Alaska</h5> Here is the <a href=http://www.alaska.gov/ target="_new"> link to Alaska.</a>. This website was not as detailed when it came to the design and general layout of the page. It did seem easy to navigate however, and I liked the images of the mountain ranges that were on the front page.
 <h6> 5. Oklahoma </h6> Here is the <a href=http://www.ok.gov/ target="_new"> link to Oklahoma.</a>.
 This website seemed very bland compared to the others. It was not that exciting to look at. One thing I did like however, was the background of the pages, which was the praries. This page was not as well laid out as the others, and it was harder to find information. Each part of the website also loaded very quickly.
